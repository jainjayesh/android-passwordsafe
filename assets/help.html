<h1>Help</h1>

<h2>Categories</h2>

<p>Categories are used to contain passwords.   You might have one for Work and 
 one for Personal.  This helps keep your passwords organized.</p>

<p>Begin by adding one via the Menu.   After you've created one, you can touch it
 to open that category.   Once a category is selected you may then create password entries.</p>


<h2>Passwords</h2>

<p>After first selecting a category, you may Edit, Add or Delete password entries
 from the Password List activity.</p>

<p>Password entries consist of the following fields:<p>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Description is a required field.   This is what is shown in the password list.</dd>

<dt>Website</dt>
<dd>If appropriate, provide the full URL to the website associated with this entry.</dd>

<dt>Username</dt>
<dd>Username for the password, if appropriate.</dd>

<dt>Password</dt>
<dd>Finally the password itself.</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>Miscellaneous notes about this entry.  You may type as much as you want, the field
 will expand to accommodate.</dd>
</dl>
 
<h2>Security Concerns</h2>
 
<p>Password Safe was written to safely store your passwords so that nobody can see
  them other than you.
  The password you use to unlock Password Safe is used to encrypt the data.
  Data is stored within a SQLite database within your phone.   That database stays
  local.  It does not get transferred to the Internet.   In fact, the application
  doesn't have the security privileges to even access the Internet.</p>
  
<p>Because Password Safe cannot access the Internet, the data is not backed up.
  In order to backup, you will need to export to a CSV and store that file
  in some other secure fashion.</p>

<h3>Locking</h3>

<p>Any of the following actions will cause Password Safe to lock:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The screen turns off.  This is a default behavior of the phone and is controlled
   in the phone's Settings -&gt; Sound &amp; display -> Screen timeout.   
   The default timeout is 1 minute.
   After 1 minute the phone will go to sleep.   When this happens, Password Safe will 
   lock itself.</li>
  <li>You select <i>Lock</i> from the Menu on the Categories screen.</li>
  <li>Android only allows six active applications.  Once you launch the seventh,
   the oldest used application will be killed.  If Password Safe is killed, than
   the next time you launch it, it will be locked.</li>
</ul>

<p>Really, the easiest way to lock is to just hit the power button on the phone briefly and
 turn off the screen.</p>
