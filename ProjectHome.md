## Old Info ##

A password safe for Android that protects your passwords with
[AES encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).
All encrypted information is stored in a database on the phone.
No information is kept online.   The only way to backup currently is
through the export feature.

## What it looks like ##

Here are the various screens you'll see using Password Safe.

select a category in order to create passwords.
